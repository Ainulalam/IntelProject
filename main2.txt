Certainly! Let's build a more complete and realistic application in Python that securely stores user passwords (hashed and encrypted) on disk. This application will include proper key management, error handling, and demonstrate how to securely handle user passwords.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
bcrypt library (for password hashing)
cryptography library (for encryption)
Application Overview:
This application will allow users to register and securely store their passwords. Passwords will be hashed using bcrypt and then encrypted using cryptography before being stored in a file (passwords.dat). We'll also implement basic login functionality to demonstrate password verification.

Implementation:
python
Copy code
import bcrypt
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import os

# Generate or load encryption key securely
# In a real application, store this key securely (e.g., environment variables, secret management services)
encryption_key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher_suite = Fernet(encryption_key)

# File to store encrypted passwords
PASSWORDS_FILE = 'passwords.dat'

# Function to encrypt data
def encrypt_data(data):
    encrypted_data = cipher_suite.encrypt(data.encode('utf-8'))
    return encrypted_data

# Function to decrypt data
def decrypt_data(encrypted_data):
    decrypted_data = cipher_suite.decrypt(encrypted_data).decode('utf-8')
    return decrypted_data

# Function to hash a password
def hash_password(password):
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
    hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt)
    return hashed_password

# Function to store a new user's password securely
def store_password(username, password):
    # Hash the password
    hashed_password = hash_password(password)
    
    # Encrypt the hashed password
    encrypted_password = encrypt_data(hashed_password)
    
    # Store the encrypted password in the file
    with open(PASSWORDS_FILE, 'ab') as f:
        f.write(username.encode('utf-8') + b':' + encrypted_password + b'\n')
    
    print(f"Password for user '{username}' stored securely.")

# Function to verify login credentials
def verify_password(username, password):
    # Read and decrypt stored passwords
    if not os.path.exists(PASSWORDS_FILE):
        print("No users registered yet.")
        return False
    
    with open(PASSWORDS_FILE, 'rb') as f:
        for line in f:
            parts = line.strip().split(b':')
            stored_username = parts[0].decode('utf-8')
            encrypted_password = parts[1]
            
            if stored_username == username:
                # Decrypt the encrypted password
                decrypted_password = decrypt_data(encrypted_password)
                
                # Check if the password matches
                if bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode('utf-8'), decrypted_password.encode('utf-8')):
                    print(f"Login successful. Welcome, '{username}'!")
                    return True
                else:
                    print("Incorrect password.")
                    return False
        
        print(f"User '{username}' not found.")
        return False

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Register a new user
    store_password('alice', 'password123')
    
    # Login with correct password
    verify_password('alice', 'password123')
    
    # Login with incorrect password
    verify_password('alice', 'wrongpassword')
Explanation:
Encryption Key: Fernet.generate_key() generates a new encryption key each time the application runs. In a real application, store and manage this key securely.
store_password Function: Takes a username and password, hashes the password using bcrypt, encrypts it using Fernet, and stores it in PASSWORDS_FILE.
verify_password Function: Takes a username and password, reads and decrypts stored passwords from PASSWORDS_FILE, then verifies the password against the stored hash using bcrypt.
Security Considerations:
Key Management: Store the encryption_key securely (e.g., environment variables, secret management services).
File Permissions: Set appropriate file permissions to restrict access to PASSWORDS_FILE.
Error Handling: Add robust error handling for file operations, decryption failures, etc.
Testing: Conduct thorough testing to ensure security and functionality.
Notes:
This example provides basic functionality. In a production application, consider additional features like password complexity requirements, user registration/validation, and more advanced security measures.
This application demonstrates how to securely store and verify user passwords using hashing and encryption techniques in Python. Ensure you understand and follow security best practices when handling sensitive information like passwords.
